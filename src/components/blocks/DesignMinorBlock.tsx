                    Design attributes, such as creativity and aesthetic
                    sensibility, are natural talents that can be cultivated
                    through education. The Minor Program in Design helps
                    students unleash their design potential and build up a
                    creative portfolio. Solving complex problems through systems
                    thinking, ISD can achieve its vision of a better life for
                    everyone. In the program, students learn fundamental design
                    theories, principles and methods, and how to solve
                    real-world problems via project-based learning. Students can
                    apply design knowledge to their own projects in their
                    disciplines to advance innovation, which is the key
                    objective of this Minor Program.
