        "details": "Inspired by the octopus, Prof. Rob SCHARFF's team has developed artificial suction cups that can grasp objects and sense their surroundings. The artificial suction cups could enable the implementation of octopus-inspired manipulation strategies in soft continuum robot arms. The research conducted by first author Stein VAN VEGGEL (TU Delft) was a collaboration between HKUST, Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), and the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT). \n\n\n\nPublished in Advanced Intelligent Systems, the paper titled “Optoelectronically Innervated Suction Cup Inspired by the Octopus” introduces a 3D-printed octopus-inspired suction cup with integrated colored markers. Tactile information is collected using an embedded camera that captures the displacement of these markers upon contact between the suction cup and its environment. This information could be employed to accurately estimate the orientation of the suction cup with respect to an object surface. The effectiveness of the approach was demonstrated in a closed-loop control scheme where the suction cup could successfully pick up randomly oriented objects by approaching the object surface perpendicularly.  \n\n\n \nThe work was motivated by the findings from a literature review on artificial suction cups by the same authors published in Advanced Science. In this work, titled “Classification and Evaluation of Octopus-Inspired Suction Cups for Soft Continuum Robots”, the authors identified the lack of high-resolution tactile sensors for artificial suction cups as one of the major hurdles towards the realization of octopus-like dexterous manipulation capabilities in soft continuum robot arms.",

        "details": "The modern urban built environment has been a contributor to the social, health and ecological crises faced by cities around the world, while the emergence of artificial intelligence and the new multi-polar global order present both opportunities and existential threats. To address these crises, it is imperative for the architecture and creative profession to take up the social responsibility through more conscious design, bridging the gaps between abstract data and human empathy, between the authorities and the communities, and between technology and everyday life. It is in these contexts that the research laboratory Social Urban Lab (SOULab) and design consultancy COLOURS: Collectively Ours were set up as complementary practice to investigate the people-environment dynamics and translate data-driven, community-based research into evidence-based design for health, equity, agency and urban life. In this talk, Dr Chong will also share how he envisions the future of creative education in the Intelligent Age.\n\n# Speaker’s biography:\n\nDr. Chong Keng Hua is currently Associate Professor of Architecture and Sustainable Design at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), where he directs the Social Urban Lab (SOULab), DesignZ Positive City Lab, and the Opportunity Lab (O-Lab). He is also Founding Partner of COLOURS: Collectively Ours, an award-winning design consultancy specializing in public space and social impact, as well as Visiting Senior Academician at Changi General Hospital, Singapore. He will be the Provost and Vice President (Academic) of Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) at the newly established University of the Arts Singapore (UAS). \n\n\n\nA firm believer in design activism, Dr. Chong has been advocating social architecture and participatory community design in the region. He initiated PARK(ing) Day Singapore in 2013 together with his students, which has since become a nation-wide annual placemaking movement. He has also led students to work on community development projects in Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, and China. He is active in several international organisations, including Pacific Rim Community Design Network, and Design for the Common Good International Network.\n\n\n\nDr. Chong’s research on social architecture particularly in the areas of ageing, health and data-driven community design has led to extensive international publications, including Second Beginnings (Lien Foundation, 2018), Creative Ageing Cities (Routledge, 2018) and upcoming book Data-driven Smart Community Design (Routledge, 2025). Design interventions led by him have won numerous awards, including the latest Seoul Design Award 2024.\n\n\n\nGraduated with PhD in Architecture from National University of Singapore, Dr. Chong has been Visiting Professor at Aalto University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Zhejiang University. He was Curator of Singapore Pavilion at Seoul Biennale 2017 and Venice Biennale 2018, as well as Festival Director of Singapore Archifest 2020.\n\n\n",

        "details": "# Abstract \n\n This seminar will detail a systematic \"plant-to-bottle\" pipeline for developing and commercializing patented bioactives that target the fundamental hallmarks of aging in skin. The process starts with preparations of novel bioactives, progresses through large-scale screening and action mechanism studies, and culminates in multi-level validation using artificial skin model, leading to optimized delivery systems and successful clinical trials. The presentation will showcase two key examples of this translational success: an patented autophagy inducer developed to clear cellular damage and an extract from the Kinkeliba plant (Combretum micranthum) from west africa that provides significant anti-inflammaging benefits. Successfully translating this complex longevity science faces significant challenges, including establishing robust scale-up optimization technologies, navigating complex cosmetic regulatory frameworks while making science-backed claims, and clearly communicating complex biological concepts like autophagy and inflammaging to the consumer. This work illustrates the integration of biotechnology and life science to deliver validated skin longevity solutions with significant scientific, consumer, and societal impact, despite these commercial and technical hurdles. \n \n # Biography \n \n Dr. Shuting Hu is a scientist-entrepreneur bridging advanced academic discovery and real-world impact in skin longevity. She earned her Ph.D. in Biological Sciences from The University of Hong Kong, with research spanning autophagy, chronic inflammation, and DNA repair mechanism. She is the author of 10+ peer-reviewed publications and inventor on 9 patents (4 granted), developing novel bioactives including autophagy inducers and compounds for pigmentation disorder treatment, anti-inflammaging, and DNA photoprotection. \n \n As founder & CEO of Acaderma, a biotech skincare brand dedicated to skin longevity, Dr. Hu translates advanced longevity science into patented, ethically sourced skincare. Her research-led approach delivers products that target key hallmarks of ageing with proven efficacy. Her innovation has been recognized with Vogue Business's Beauty Game Changer Award (2025), the Longevity 100 Award, the IFSCC Young Cosmetic Scientist Award (2014), and selection as a Global Finalist in L'Oréal Innovation Runway (2017). She was also the first Asian entrepreneur in Sephora's Accelerate (2018). \n  \n Committed to social impact, she advances ethical sourcing and community empowerment through partnerships with African NGO ASNAPP, helping educate and equip women farmers with sustainable-farming skills and income opportunities. Dr. Hu’s work exemplifies rigorous science scaled through technology transfer, manufacturing optimization, and responsible commercialization—reshaping how we age through the lens of longevity",

In this talk, I will present two innovative approaches to address this challenge. First, using virtual screening, we identified Parthenolide (PNL), a natural sesquiterpene lactone, as a novel dual agonist of adiponectin receptors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2. Chronic PNL administration in high-fat diet-fed mice significantly improved obesity, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that PNL directly activates hepatic AdipoR1/R2 signaling via the APPL1 pathway, enhances AMPK/PPAR-α signaling in adipose tissue, and improves insulin sensitivity in adipocytes. Second, we developed a robust high-throughput screening (HTS) platform utilizing OP9 cells with an adiponectin promoter-driven luciferase reporter, and discovered that pazopanib, an FDA-approved anti-cancer drug, acts as a potent adiponectin enhancer. Pazopanib enhances adiponectin in mature adipocytes as well as enhances adipogenesis with different mechanisms. In a mouse model of cancer cachexia, accelerated the recovery of fat mass and muscle endurance, elevated adiponectin levels and reduced adipose tissue fibrosis, identifies pazopanib’s new function as a metabolic enhancer besides its anti-tumor role. Together, these studies not only introduce promising new modulators of adiponectin signaling but also demonstrate the power and utility of our screening platform for the discovery of novel therapeutic compounds targeting metabolic disorders. \n \n # Biography \n \n  Dr. Zhu Yuyan is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Food Science and Nutrition at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU).

Everywhere, Anywhere, All at Once reflects a new paradigm in which opportunities emerge simultaneously across markets, disciplines, and institutional boundaries. Drawing on my own experiences building technology ventures in Hong Kong, leading a national innovation ecosystem in the Middle East, and advising global organizations, this talk examines the structural forces that now define entrepreneurial possibility and risk. We will analyze how AI-enabled capabilities, shifting value chains, and new models of cross-border collaboration create both openings and constraints for today’s founders. By situating practical lessons within broader academic frameworks—innovation diffusion, ecosystem design, and strategic adaptability—the session aims to equip students with a rigorous understanding of how to identify, evaluate, and pursue global opportunities in an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical landscape \n \n # Biography \n \n  Jack is the former President of the Qatar Science and Technology Park which is situated in the Education City of Qatar, under the Leadership of Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser. \n \n Jack first obtained his BS and MS degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences from the University of California, Berkeley.
