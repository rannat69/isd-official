                </b>
                (previously known as Integrative Systems and Design) with the
                objective to provide a stimulating environment for students to
                integrate design skills with domain expertise, which currently
                includes mechanical engineering, electrical and electronics
                engineering as well as computer science and engineering, in an
                interdisciplinary environment. The teaching methodology used by
                the Division is active learning, which engages students actively
                in the learning process. In this process, students increase
                their focus and attention helping them develop a deep
                understanding of complex issues related to engineering and
                design. A unique feature of this UG program is that this program
                adopts team-based and project-based learning as the primary
                method of instruction. Students have to work on project courses
                thought-out their four years of study. These project courses
                represent an important component of IDT design-infused
                curriculum, which provides students opportunities to practice
                integration of design skills while developing expertise in
                different engineering disciplines.
